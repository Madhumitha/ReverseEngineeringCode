 # ReverseEngineeringCode

```
As a developer

I WANT a walk-through of the codebase

SO THAT I can use it a starting point for a new project
```

## Business Context

When joining a new team, you will be expected to inspect a lot of code that you have been seen before. Rather than having a team member explain every line for you, you will dissect the code by yourself, saving any questions for a member of your team. 

```
GIVEN a Node.js application using Sequelie and Passport
WHEN I follow the walkthrough
THEN I understand the codebase
```
